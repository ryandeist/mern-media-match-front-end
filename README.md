# Media Match App (Front End)

![Show Page Screenshot](public/Library.png)

This repository contains the front-end code for **Media Match**, a MERN stack app that helps users build a game library based on their preferences, with future support for other media. It offers a simple interface for discovering new content.  

Developing this app allowed our team to showcase Reactâ€™s strengths, including reusable components, `useContext`, `useEffect`, and service functions to connect our Express API and perform CRUD operations.

## Overview
- This app runs on our [Media Match Express API](https://github.com/adampaley/mern-media-match-back-end) for back-end handling and the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started) for game data.  
- It includes basic authorization with validation to prevent incorrect credentials or duplicate accounts.  
- Only signed-in users can access CRUD operations, while guests can only view the Landing, Sign-In, and Sign-Up pages.  
- Signed-in users can navigate five main sections:  
  - **Dashboard**: Fetches product data based on user settings, displaying one item at a time in CardDetails component. This CardDetails component renders conditionally and is used in the Library and Cart for similar purposes. In the card users can view product details, add (`CREATE`) items to their cart, or remove them from the queue.  
  - **Settings**: Users can set (`CREATE`) or adjust (`UPDATE`) content preferences via a settings drawer, filtering products by the API by genre. Preferences persist until changed.  
  - **Cart**: Displays (`READ`) added items. Users can "purchase" (`CREATE`) items into their library or remove (`DELETE`) them from the cart.  
  - **Library**: Shows (`READ`) purchased items. Users can remove (`UPDATE`) items or leave a review. The component is shared with the cart view, rendering conditionally.  
  - **Review**: Users can write (`CREATE`), read (`READ`), edit (`UPDATE`), or delete (`DELETE`) reviews.  
- User data, including settings, cart and purchases, persist after sign-out.
